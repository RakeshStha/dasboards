# Dashboard UI Design

* Dasboard UI design using pure Html5, CSS, JavaScript, JSON and React

Here I have created a dashboard with a clean UI for the provided user data set i.e users.json and subscriptions.json
* In table format I have listed the subscribers with applicable visual presentation.
* Include the option for sort and filter i.e sort through a ascending order and descending order & filter by typing text on input.
* In table format I have listed the subscritions details of each users, here  I have linked id and user_id from both users.json and subscriptions.json dataset.
* Used async method to fetch the dataset of JSON.
* No any bootstrap/css framework is used. All the code written in pure html, css, json, js and React.
